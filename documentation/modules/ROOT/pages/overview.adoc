[#file-structure]
== Course Directory Structure

The course repository has the following structure:

image::repo_structure.png[]

=== apps

The apps folder is used to add any demo/example applications that will be used in course exercies, e.g. a Java application which will be used to show how to build the container image

=== documentation

All the content within this directory are called https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/resource-id/[resources] and are uniquely identifed by Antora using resource ID.

The documention folder is where all the ASCIIDoc will be placed. The course site will be generated using the docs, assets from this folder.


=== Module Manifest 

==== *File*: _documentation/antora.yml_

This is kind of the manifest file that uniquely identifies the course. More info on antora.yml is available in official https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/component-version-descriptor/[Antora docs]

=== Modules

==== *Folder*: _documentation/modules_

This directory holds the various modules that are part of this course. Module is a logical seperation of content. By default a ROOT module is created as part of the template.

=== Navigation

==== *File*: _documentation/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc_

The nav.adoc holds the navgation and menus for the course. For an example the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer-demos/knative-tutorial-module-serving/master/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc[navigation content] will generate a navigation structure as shown below:

image::navigation.png[align="right"]

Refer to https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/navigation/[Antora navgation] for more information.

=== Content Docs

==== *Folder*: _documentation/modules/ROOT/pages_

All the course content AsciiDoc should be placed in this folder. The template adds to example content pages like 01-setup.adoc and 02-deploy.adoc. You can use them to get started.

=== Attributes

==== *File*: _documentation/modules/ROOT/pages/_attributes.adoc_

Any attributes that will be used in the pages can be set in this doc and included in all the needed content pages via `include::_attributes.adoc[]`.  The AsciiDoc interpolation happens using the pattern `pass:[{attribute-name}]`

[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
-----
= {title}
\include::_attributes.adoc[]
-----

More information on how to define and use attributes is available https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/define-and-modify-attributes/[here]. Also check the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/attributes/[out of box attributes] that are available for use.

=== Image Assets

==== *Folder*: _documentation/modules/ROOT/assets/images_

All the assets such as images can be placed in this folder and can be referred using the macro `image::<your-image-path>`. If you create a folder within this folder then your macro needs to be adjusted like `image::<your-folder>/<your-image-path>`.

[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
-----
image::<your-image-path>[]
-----

=== Examples

==== *documentation/modules/ROOT/examples*

If you want to inline the code in a listing with a source from a file, then add the file to this folder and use the include macro like:

[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
-----
[source,yaml]
----
\include::examples/foo.yaml[]
----
-----

Refer to https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/examples-directory/[docs] for more information on the examples directory.

[#partials]
=== Partials

==== *documentation/modules/ROOT/partials*

https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/partials-directory/#partials[Partials] allows you to reuse content(AsciiDoc) snippets via special include macro. 

Say for example you want to have the following AsciiDoc content:

[source,adoc]
-----
Check that the pod is up and running:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl get pods
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
{podname}   1/1     Running   0          5s
----

Then let's go into the running pod to execute some commands:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl exec -ti {podname} /bin/bash
----

NOTE: Change the pod name with your pod name.

-----

The you can create file called `exec-pod.adoc` in the documentation/modules/ROOT/partials and include it using the include macro like:

[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
-----
\include::partial$exec_pod.adoc[]
-----

The partials could be created in any module, if you wish to include a parital from a module called `foo` then its include syntax will look like:

[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
------
\include::foo:partial$exec_pod.adoc[]
------

Refer to the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/include-a-partial/[parital docs] for more patterns and customization.

[#including-remote-content]
== Including Remote Content

Any remote AsciiDoc content could included using the `include` macro and using the http urls of the remote content:

[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
------
\include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-scholars/demo-couse/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc[]
------
